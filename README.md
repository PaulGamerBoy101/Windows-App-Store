> An Alternative to the Microsoft Store

## About

"Windows Applications Store" was Made Using Python, It Uses a Manualy Made/Provided JSON File to Fetch & Display Results. At the Moment the Apps List is Limited, But You Are Free to Make a Pull Request & Add More Apps to the List, More Apps Will Also Be Added Over Time.

- Disclaimer: No Files are Actually Hosted by Me, At the Moment this Store Is Simply a Database to Display Apps And A Few Sources To Download them From, Hopefully Sometime In The Future I Will Be Able to Host the Files to Download.
